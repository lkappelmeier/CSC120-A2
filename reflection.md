What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I would definitely say to start the assignment earlier than you would think. I started over the weekend and needed a day or two just to think of what the assignment was asking. On that note, I feel like the instructions were not clear until the Old MacDonald example and it finally clicked. If we had done that a little earlier, I think I would have understood it sooner. The advice we got today (February 6th) in class was very helpful about thinking and working through it without coding at first. I think I jumped into the actual coding too soon and ended up confusing myself.
